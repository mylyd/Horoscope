    "analysis":"Intelligent, kind, and always willing to put others before themselves, Libras value harmony in all forms. Ruled by Venus, the planet of beauty, Libra adores a life that looks good. As the master of compromise and diplomacy, Libra is adept at seeing all points of view, and excels at crafting compromises and effecting mediation between others.  \n\n Libras believe that they're directing their own lives, and they take a big-picture approach in making that life look and feel the best it can be. They spend a lot of time figuring out what's missing from that big picture, and they may feel unhappy if they become too focused on one thing, whether it's work, a partner, or a family member.  \n\n When Libra falls in love, he or she falls hard, but this sign also recognizes that there's room for more than one grand love in his or her life. The Scales are pragmatic about love, realizing that different relationships often have different seasons. Librans can sometimes be accused of being too pragmatic, and they've been known to call off a relationship pre-emptively if they feel it may not work due to distance, age difference, or another external conflict. \n\n Libra is fiercely attracted to intelligence, which is just as important as appearance when it comes to the partners they end up falling for. This sign is all about cerebral connectionsâ€”role-playing, dirty talk, and games in the bedroom all serve to amp up their interest. Physical connection is nice, but a sexy Snap can truly crank up a Libra's libido.",
