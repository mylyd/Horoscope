		"career": "This team has the power to bring out the very best in each other. The Aries easily inspires the Pisces, bringing excitement and zest to the table. With such strong leadership qualities, an Aries can fire up their partner, and get the ball rolling. The Pisces, on the other hand, brings stability and emotional expression to this team. Creativity flows wonderfully when a Pisces is on the job, enhancing the Aries' approach to reaching goals.\n\nChallenges may occur when the Pisces feels stuck or stagnant, and seems unwilling to explore the possibilities of change. Further, if the Aries seems overpowering, there can be conflict. Be sure to hear one another out and to show respect for differences.",
		"friendship": "Forthright Aries and reserved Pisces form an unlikely friendship. Although the Ram is bold and outgoing and the Fish is shy and reclusive, they do have some things in common. Both are highly sensitive to criticism. Aries tends to lash out when hurt, while Pisces usually turns silent. Neither is a stranger to pain. By bolstering each other's egos, these two can be a strong support system. Aries encourages Pisces to develop their creative talent, while Pisces assures Aries their innovative instincts are right on target.",
		"love": "Pisces has a fleeting and almost solitary spirit which may provoke the Aries authoritarian tendencies, and the two signs do not soothe each other. Pisces readily submits to domination, since he or she is awash in an inner world where reality has little effect. The vitality of Aries provides needed security. The couple will function if the Ram surrounds the Pisces with constant affection. If not, the Fish will spawn elsewhere, without even turning around for a final farewell."

		"career": "The abilities and talents of each individual will bring a wonderful balance to this partnership. The Taurus is hard working, loves to do hands-on work, and is practical in most respects. The Pisces, quite differently, has a very strong imagination, intuition, and artistic character. One of the best ways for this team to work is for the Pisces to do the planning, envisioning, and creative thinking, and for the Taurus to do the nitty-gritty work.\n\nIt can be challenging for this unique pair to find a working rhythm together. Each will have to come to terms with their differences. For example, the Pisces may procrastinate whereas the Taurus is persistent. Careful planning and regular check-ins can be especially helpful.",
		"friendship": "Factual Taurus may not seem to have much in common with fantastic Pisces at first glance. After scratching each other's surfaces, though, they'll find a great deal in common. Both love beauty, art, and harmony. Each is laid-back and agreeable. Taurus delights in making Pisces laugh, while Pisces enjoys getting Taurus to loosen up. The Bull won't appreciate Pisces's forgetful ways, while the Fish will shake their head at Taurus's material concerns. Fortunately, both signs are very tolerant and will refrain from scolding each other.",
		"love": "They get along perfectly! The poetic, sensitive Fish seeks ways to make the Taurean happy, in exchange for the tenderness and security he needs. They enjoy going out together as well as the intimacy of their home. Their physical love is alchemical, spiritual, and intense. The Bull's practical side helps the Pisces to accomplish the projects bubbling up in his or her imagination; a quality which the stolid Taurus needs to lighten his sometimes monotonous life. The outlook for love is promising."

Not only that, but the Gemini's innate joy of talking aligns perfectly with the Pisces' love of listening. This is a combination that will truly enjoy each other's company while, at the same time, get the work done. The Piscean gains from the practical, determined character of the Gemini. This can prevent procrastination in this team. Further, the easy-going flow of the Pisces helps the Gemini to remain versatile and flexible. Intellectual work is often best suited to this pair.\n\nThe Piscean can become confused easily at times, especially when the pressure is on to wrap a project up. While this isn't something a Gemini finds especially challenging, it can be irritating for the air sign to deal with. On the other hand, when the Gemini is ultra serious and focused, the Pisces can become uncomfortable. Time to adjust, regroup, and accept is necessary for this flexible pair.",
		"friendship": "Gemini and Pisces are two totally different people who have lots to teach each other. Gemini is great at shaking off disappointment and finding fresh opportunities. Pisces is adept at forming meaningful relationships that last a lifetime. If the Twins can endure Pisces's emotional rollercoaster and the Fish can put up with Gemini's neuroses, these two can be good friends. Gemini is impressed with Pisces's creative talent, while Pisces thinks Gemini is as smart as a whip. They're both versatile and can make allowances for each other's shortcomings.",
		"love": "Pisces swims through deep waters, while the Gemini inhabits the airs. One is a contemplative, solitary being, while the other enjoys discussions. Pisces seeks absolute love and emotional intensity; if the Gemini can stretch his or her imagination to attain the emotional commitment which is alien to him or her, the couple will experience an extraordinary spiritual union. They share a taste for freedom: the Fish to explore his imaginary world, while the Gemini craves a chance to display charisma in the outer world. They may embark on a long journey, or bid each other farewell before casting off."

Two water signs will naturally flow well together, bringing an easy-going and friendly atmosphere to most any environment. Just to be around this pair will feel soothing and calming. Both value relationships above all else, from people to animals. Work that involves the care of others is also well suited for this couple.\n\nChallenges will arise for both the Cancer and the Pisces when placed in a working role that requires more intellect than serving others. This can create melancholy that is damaging to working projects. Further, it can be tough for this pair to lift one another's spirits when both are feeling down.",
		"friendship": "Cancer and Pisces are great pals. Loving Cancer enjoys lavishing insecure Pisces with affection. The expressive Fish adores drawing the Crab out of its shell. There will be times when Cancer gets exasperated with Pisces's irresponsible behavior with money. Pisces, on the other hand, will roll their eyes at Cancer's career obsessions. For the most part, they'll overlook each other's weaknesses. They're both very artistic and may enjoy collaborating on creative projects together. These friends are a terrific support system for one another.",
		"love": "When these two Water signs flow together, the Moon soon locks into Neptune's orbit. Cancer and Pisces intuitively understand each other; they handle each other's sensitivity with respect, care, and gentleness. Their personalities are likely to merge. In physical love, they give of their souls for mutual delight. Loathing power struggles, they silently respect each other's solitude, and barely need to speak aloud. Pragmatic Cancer can relieve dreamy Pisces of life's daily tasks. If the latter is willing to settle down, total harmony is in store for them."

Such is usually the case with a Leo and a Pisces. The shared love of artistic expression creates a common ground for this pair to build upon. When facing a project that requires endurance, and even sacrifice, this couple won't shy away. The Leo brings generosity, while the Pisces gives rhythm.\n\nChallenges may arise if the Leo is too authoritative with the Pisces. Further, each person is likely to require a strong sense of purpose with his or her work. Each thrives on being truly inspired by what they do. Therefore, projects that do not speak to this creative pair will take a long time to get done.",
		"friendship": "Leo and Pisces form an unusual alliance. Outgoing Leo is mystified by the Fish's reclusive ways. Introverted Pisces will tire of the Lion's self-centered stories. However, all is not lost on the friendship front. Both signs have a deep appreciation for fantasy and glamour. They'll find they share lots of the same taste in movies. They'll admire each other's fashion sense. Above all, they'll connect over their mutual desire to transcend mundane reality. If Leo can put up with Pisces's tearful outbursts, Pisces will tolerate the Lion's gargantuan ego.",
		"love": "Both thrill to the feeling of unconditional love, and their secret sexual garden will bear delicious fruit. However, the Pisces, unconcerned with material things, will treat the Lion's gifts lightly. The regal lifestyle and authoritarian character will arouse resistance. The Piscean will not submit; instead, he or she will retreat into an inner world, indifferent to the crashing surf above. The Leo, left alone, will be profoundly wounded. Yet if the Pisces remains by the Leo's side, it will be a sign that he or she is finding true emotional fulfillment. And vice-versa."

		"career": "Astrologically, the Virgo and the Pisces are a polarity - they are opposites in the zodiac. The key phrase for the Virgo is \"I analyze,\" while the Pisces' is \"I believe.\" Although these two are considerably different in perspective and approach, each can offer strength to the other. The Pisces lends the power of intuitiveness and dreams to the traditionally \"seeing-is-believing\" Virgo, enabling each to consider more options and possibilities. The Virgo brings a strong work ethic and dedication to practicality that can encourage the Pisces to be more responsible in their decision-making. Work that involves creativity in the finer details is apt to go over well.\n\nDifferences can also bring challenge to the team of Pisces and Virgo. Each of these signs can be intolerant and impatient toward each other. Time is the only means to beat this tendency, as neither person can be rushed to like the other one.",
		"friendship": "Practical Virgo has difficulty relating to dreamy Pisces. These two signs are opposites in many ways, but this doesn't mean they can't be friends. Virgo has tremendous intellectual gifts but is sometimes shy about sharing them. Supportive Pisces will help find an audience for Virgo's scientific, social, and creative work. Na\u00efve Pisces has difficulty spotting manipulators, which is where discerning Virgo can be a tremendous help. Both are service-oriented signs that may enjoy doing volunteer work, especially if it involves rescuing animals or other innocent creatures.",
		"love": "Piscean imagination and poetry provide needed relief to Virgoan common sense, broadening horizons which would otherwise become monotonous. These two individuals share an open-mindedness which would promote discovery, and they may find a way to be happy together. The Piscean can sense the Virgo's desires intuitively, which is ideal for their sex life. If the Virgoan respects the Fish's mysterious inner depths, he or she will derive great rewards from Pisces. A sense of love is one of the gifts both individuals possess."

Regardless of what the task is, chances are music will jingle along with the productivity, and plenty of chatter will be heard as well. This is a great team, and one that can accomplish a great deal of work amidst the singing and chitchat.\n\nThere are not apt to be a lot of difficulties or challenges with this couple. Both people will, however, feel terribly restricted should the working environment prohibit a relaxed, fun approach. This can put a real damper on spirit and positive productivity.",
		"friendship": "Libra and Pisces have radically different guides to life. Libra is led by their intellect, while Pisces operates on intuition. If these two signs turn to each other for help, they will form a formidable friendship. Libra will discourage Pisces from falling victim to irrational fears, insisting the Fish get the facts before making wild assumptions. Pisces will help Libra see that there is more to life than meets the eye. Both have a deep appreciation for art and a dislike of confrontation. This is a pleasant alliance.",
		"love": "A shared delight in culture, art, and literature gives this Air/Water duo a definite mutual attraction. But the gap between them may soon grow difficult to bridge with understanding. Each must be alert to this fact. A Piscean needs regular doses of solitude, whereas the Libran cannot thrive without the admiration of others. If each respects this basic difference, the Libran can bring the Pisces a pragmatism alien to the latter's abstract world. In exchange, the Pisces provides a glimpse of his or her rich imagination - as long as the partner does not probe too insistently."

		"career": "A common preference for an easy flowing atmosphere, with no chaos swirling about, is prized in this working combination. Both being water signs, the Scorpio and the Pisces can become rattled and confused when too much is going on directly around them. In this regard, they understand each other quite well. Both are also intensely emotional. Yet, in other ways, there are significant differences that can work toward enhancing their partner's qualities. The Scorpio has strong analytical skills, whereas the Pisces is more intuitive.\n\nThese differences can also pose challenges to this pair. A Scorpio isn't apt to feel comfortable putting any work off. Diligence is far more this person's way. Alternately, the Pisces can find the sting of the Scorpio's tongue a bit much to take at times. Each will need to exercise tolerance and patience for best results.",
		"friendship": "These two Water Signs are terrific friends. Protective Scorpio loves caring for vulnerable Pisces. The whimsical Fish enjoys lifting Scorpio's spirits. They're highly creative people who love collaborating on writing, music, and design projects. When they're not working, they have fun trading books, watching movies and going to concerts together. Scorpio sometimes complains about the Fish's lazy habits, while Pisces will turn its tail at Scorpio's nasty streak. Fortunately, they are both very sensitive and will quickly apologize for hurting each other. This is a friendship that can afford tremendous happiness.",
		"love": "Sensitive and instinctive, Scorpio and Pisces have a mutual affinity only rarely encountered in the zodiac. They may be devoted to one another body and soul; their love is erotic, all-encompassing, and often unique. A gaze speaks volumes of poetry, and intuition replaces reason. Their magical bond is immune to everything except Scorpio's jealousy. If it looms, Pisces will dart away on the first wave. He or she loathes ugly emotional confrontations, and this feeling is stronger than his or her passionate love for the Scorpio."

Both are imaginative, intuitive, creative and enthusiastic about the possibilities of what can be done. This bodes extremely well when working together on projects that are artistic in nature. Industries such as magazine production, designing and music or theater production suit this duo perfectly, where visualization and understanding are routinely needed.\n\nOne major challenge for this pair is the proclivity for both to procrastinate. This is not to say that each isn't going to complete the work before them, but rather to note that much is left to the last minute when not guarded against.",
		"friendship": "Irreverent Sagittarius enjoys the company of whimsical Pisces, albeit in small doses. Both these signs are spontaneous individuals who love acting on impulse. The Archer won't enjoy tending to the Fish's mood swings, while Pisces doesn't appreciate Sagittarius's brutal honesty. Still, these versatile creatures can have lots of fun together. If Sagittarius can adopt a milder tone, Pisces will be less maudlin. They're both quite spiritual and might attend religious services together. Collaborating on humanitarian projects can also be enjoyable for these two.",
		"love": "Intuitive and independent creatures, they have much to share. Sagittarius can help Pisces make his or her dreams reality, but the former's critical mind and frankness may wound the latter's hypersensitive nature. They don't infringe on each other's freedom: each needs something different, and they respect the boundaries at home. But if one partner must submit to the other, it will be the Pisces, who is given to sacrifice. True, the same Pisces, who craves infinite love, may suffer from the Sagittarian lack of passion."

A Pisces is receptive to ideas - even those that seem far-fetched. They are willing to reach beyond the expected. Uniting this with the Capricorn's keen sense of caution and responsibility gets the work done with flair. This partnership can enhance one another's talents a great deal by encouraging each person to tap into the lesser-used parts of their abilities.\n\nPisces is an emotional sign. Capricorn is not. This can lead to challenges in levels of compassion and patience along the way. The best way to work around this major difference in attitude is to take a break from one another when the atmosphere gets intense.",
		"friendship": "These two signs make excellent friends. Sensible Capricorn helps impractical Pisces become more responsible. Whimsical Pisces encourages the predictable Goat to take a few risks. Capricorn is touched by the Fish's thoughtful gestures and can thrive from their tender loving care. Pisces is comforted by the Goat's strength and stability, knowing their friend will always help in emergencies. Of course, Capricorn will be impatient with Pisces' tendency to cry at sappy commercials, while Pisces will disapprove of the Goat's workaholic ways. These friends really do adore each other, though.",
		"love": "The profound Pisces sensitivity gravitates toward a solid Capricorn mooring, a reassuring and respectable person. But the total absence of materialism characteristic of the Pisces irritates the Capricorn, who knows what things are worth after having earned them through hard work. Discussion is difficult, due to the Capricorn's rock-hard realism. The Pisces floats in a spiritual, emotional, poetic medium. However, often the latter's pliancy makes it possible for him or her to submit to Capricorn's direction."

Not only can they envision the results of their concerted effort, they can do everything needed to make their ideas a reality.\n\nChallenges can occur for this combination when there is a lack of focus or direction with the work itself. It's best when things are laid out clearly right from the start. Both can become frustrated easily when they are creatively limited in what they can do with any project.",

Aquarius will get frustrated by the Fish's refusal to face facts, while Pisces will dislike the Water Bearer's inability to recognize social cues. Still, these two have quite a bit in common. Neither is particularly materialistic, so they can have a great time whether they're flush with money or totally broke. They also share a powerful desire for social justice and enjoy working together on humanitarian efforts.",
		"love": "Both signs are attracted to the arts, philosophy, and culture, so they share many ideals. But the Pisces finds the Aquarian lacking in emotion; he or she defines love as an intense experience. The Fish will soon go elsewhere in search of emotional bait. However, if the Aquarian manages to work up a little warmth and tenderness, the couple can evolve towards great intellectual and imaginative accomplishments. It's a matter of balance and availability. Pisces demands little time, which is perfect for the busy Aquarian. But if Pisces is denied affection, he or she will take off in search of it."

This team is quick at learning, and can enhance his or her skill set fairly easy, allowing for advancement. Together, they are apt to suit creative work like no other team.\n\nOn the challenging side, it's wise not to expect this couple to meet strict deadlines. One Pisces will procrastinate - let alone two! Further, it is also a part of this personality to become easily confused; therefore, a flexible time allotment is essential for this couple to do their best.",

When their schedules are free and they can come together in a spirit of harmony, it's great. They enjoy art, music, and spiritual pursuits.

Pisces are terrified of confrontation and would rather let sleeping dogs lie.",

By giving each other the time to do what they do best through patience and a willingness to hear one another out, the results are nothing less than spectacular.\n\nThe single challenge this team can face lies in getting the work completed. Short projects are best suited, as each needs a constant stream of new stimulation to remain motivated.",

Aries is a lot more excitable than steadfast Aquarius. Aquarius is much more stubborn than active Aries. At times, these two will argue about money, romantic relationships, and work. So long as they don't try to control each other, these spats will be quick and painless. Neither should attempt strong-arm tactics. Both signs cherish their independence and resent being told what to do.",
		"love": "Two forward-looking individuals who instinctively understand each other and share a vision of the future, as long as the freedom of each is respected. Aquarius is immune to the Ram's domineering spirit. But the Air sign's detachment may frustrate the Aries need for passion.

Imagination, creativity, and liveliness are part of the Aquarius' being. While the Taurus brings a hands-on approach to the partnership, the Aquarius brings motivation and ideas. When channeled toward a single goal, this can be a very powerful team.\n\nChallenges can occur when this pair isn't willing to recognize the equal value of the other person and what they contribute to the work.

Taurus will roll their eyes at Aquarius's offbeat tastes and Aquarius will call Taurus narrow-minded, but they're too laid-back to fight.",

The possessive Taurean derives his or her pleasures from immutable values like the land, the family, and the past.

While the Gemini is not considered to be the revolutionist an Aquarian often is, the dual nature of this twin sign makes their approach different than others. Further, the Gemini is incredibly talented when communicating. The Aquarius dreams the cutting-edge idea, and the Gemini communicates it clearly to others - a wonderful combination for innovative work.\n\nBoth of these signs can find themselves moody at times, and when working together, this can create a challenge or two.

Aloof Aquarius admires Gemini's ability to make friends with people from all walks of life. These two love attending parties together, separating once they arrive and then coming together to exchange notes afterward. At times, the Twins will groan about the Water Bearer's stubborn attitude. At others, Aquarius will sigh impatiently over Gemini's inability to follow through with promises. In the end, they'll set these criticisms aside and enjoy each other's company.",

This working team has a healthy blend of like-minded attributes and complementary differences, making their combined energies agreeable. The Scorpio can encourage the Aquarian to develop a stronger sense of purpose while the air sign can bring more humane endeavors into focus. Each person works well alone and with each other, and each possesses a high level of tolerance for the uniqueness of others.\n\nWork that has this team creating, researching, and serving others is ideal. While there aren't likely to be any significant challenges between each other, conditions that are restrictive or confining won't bode well for either the Scorpio or the Aquarius.",
		"friendship": "Scorpio and Aquarius first come together thinking they will change one another. After they get to know each other, these signs realize that neither will budge. Scorpio's willpower is a force of nature, while Aquarius has convictions that are deeply rooted. Fortunately, this inability to be influenced is a source of admiration. Scorpio respects how the Water Bearer marches to the beat of their own drummer. Aquarius enjoys how the Scorpion keeps them guessing. Together, they form an unusual friendship that makes onlookers scratch their heads with confusion.",
		"love": "The Aquarian flees emotional commitment, whereas the Scorpio swears by it, baffled by his or her partner's detachment. Aquarius defines him or herself as the freest of spirits; Scorpio sees love as possession, body and soul. However, as long as Plutonian jealousy is not aroused, this pair can build a mutually satisfying relationship. They respect each other and share a longing for extraordinary experiences. When the tension mounts, each can take refuge in his or her own world until it dissipates. Intuition and cleverness help this couple survive."

Both the Sagittarian and the Aquarian possess strong artistic qualities and, along with this, they each have individualism, independence, and the confidence to speak up. Thinking outside the box comes naturally to each of them, making this working team excellent for brainstorming new and innovative ways for most any situation or project.\n\nChallenges can occur if one or the other person goes off alone too far or too often. It can take some time for this pair to adjust to working collaboratively. Independence can be both the greatest asset and greatest hurdle for this relationship.",

The humanitarian Water Bearer respects Sagittarian's love of justice. They're off-beat characters who enjoy causing a commotion. Of course, they can rub each other the wrong way from time to time. The Archer doesn't like it when Aquarius gets self-righteous. The dedicated Water Bearer can't stand it when Sagittarius is unreliable. Fortunately, they know how to quarrel without inflicting serious damage. These convivial friends will have a lifetime of fun together.",

They may become active politically, or to save the environment; they discuss philosophy and human rights, and meet a wide variety of people. They never run out of ideas or causes. As for love, they respect, entertain, and enjoy each other. But neither has a taste for torrid passion. They prefer freedom to commitment.

The Capricorn will find that he or she has choices and opportunities they hadn't considered when brainstorming with this air sign. The Aquarian gains a sense of determination, discipline and traditional thinking from the Capricorn - areas that are not typically strong for this worker.\n\nWhen this unconventional couple works together, challenges are rare - providing each person sees what the other has to offer as a positive. If intolerance is present, the work will suffer as a result.",

The Goat is firmly grounded in reality, while the Water Bearer prefers the world of imagination. Still, they do have similarities. Both are determined to build things of lasting value. Capricorn can show Aquarius how to make resources stretch to the breaking point, while the Water Bearer will demonstrate the value of an extensive social network. This is a blend of energies that is challenging but rewarding.",

Career-oriented Capricorn will sacrifice anything to scale the peaks. Imaginative Aquarius thinks only of improving the future of the world and humanity.

Tackling work that is considered too far-fetched or impossible to attain brings out the best in each person.\n\nChallenges can occur when one or both Aquarians do not feel appreciated or credited for the ideas they generate or for work they produce.

Mutual toleration and love for freedom protects them from conflict.

The one significant difference however, is the Capricorn's love of interaction. Often the Taurus prefers to work away from all distractions, whereas the Capricorn enjoys salesmanship and brainstorming with colleagues from time to time.\n\nThe best way to prevent unnecessary challenges is for the Capricorn to respect their partner's need for some amount of isolation when knuckling down. Sales or interactions that the Capricorn engages in are best done away from the main work area.",

Work that is charitable, advocating or humanitarian is an excellent choice to bring out the best in both.\n\nBecause both the Sagittarian and the Libra are sensitive and benevolent, each one can find their spirits crushed when others mislead them, or when they are unable to achieve the goals they set.

He may sometimes chafe under Virgo's critical gaze. The Ram will dominate the pair, and his or her unpredictability will wreak havoc with Virgo's plans. But Virgo gives backbone to the Ram's impulses, and guides him or her with valuable advice. The alchemy of opposites forges a constructive but continually strained relationship."

Jobs that require a hands-on approach such as mechanics, agriculture, and building are excellent for their talents.\n\nBoth the Taurus and the Virgo can be stubborn at times.

While it's true that Taurus is slow to admit mistakes and Virgo is quick to point out errors, these two rarely argue. That's because they both value stability.

Work that requires an eye for detail, such as interior decorating or architectural planning, is an excellent match for this duo.\n\nOftentimes both the Gemini and the earth will want to decide what details are most important, and this can create a clash of opinions.

These two love sharing book, film, and music recommendations. They also collaborate very well. Gemini prefers to generate the ideas, while Virgo is great at implementing them. Gemini bristles at the Virgin's quest for perfection, while Virgo is exasperated by the Twins' refusal to take work seriously. Still, each admires the other's special brand of wisdom.",

This bodes well with the Cancer, whose instincts often favor relationships above all. Work that involves care giving, management or assistance is well suited.\n\nChallenges arise when the Virgo becomes overly critical, or when the Cancer is feeling melancholy.

Virgo has pure principles, refusing to be swayed by offers of money and status. When the Moon Child and Virgin come together, they feel supported. Of course, Cancer can't abide Virgo's nitpicking. Conversely, Virgo will barely tolerate Cancer's emotional outbursts. Eventually, the Moon Child will teach Virgo the value of unconditional love, while Virgo will teach Cancer not to cry over trivial matters.",

Creative juices will flow when ideas are bounced back and forth, and there'll never be any lack of motivation to get projects off the ground. When this team takes on a challenge, success is pretty much guaranteed.\n\nChallenges can occur when this pair isn't willing to hear the other person out. Further conflict can arise when competitive energy is directed at one another, rather than combined towards a specific goal. Each Aries needs to know they are valued and respected to be able to work to their full potential.",
		"friendship": "These two signs are molded by the planet Mars, so they'll lock horns frequently in small spats. Occasionally, they'll take things up a notch and create some real drama together. Aries are very protective of their personal space, so each member of this team should take pains to respect the other's domain. When these two show respect for each other's talent, things will go smoothly. They should also take turns assuming the leadership role. When forming a united front, nothing can stop this dynamic duo.",
		"love": "Two personalities governed by the planet Mars are liable to lock horns frequently in combat. Each clearly stakes out a personal territory, a turf where the Aries individuality is asserted, and it requires the unconditional respect of the other. Harmony can reign only in the presence of a powerful, shared ideal which acts to channel the awesome energy of each and unites their strengths instead of opposing them. Together, they can generate megawatts! The love which binds them is impulsive, fiery, and impatient."
