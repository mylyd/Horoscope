    "analysis":"Passionate, independent, and unafraid to blaze their own trail no matter what others think, Scorpios make a statement wherever they go. They also hate people who aren't genuine, and are all about being authentic—even if authentic isn't pretty.  \n\n Even though Scorpio may seem brusque, as a water sign, they also are very in tune with their emotions, and sometimes may find themselves caught up in their feelings. \n\n This leads to Scorpio's central conflict: Their feelings are what drives them and strengthens them, but their mutability can scare them and make them feel vulnerable and out of control. Because of this conflict, Scorpios, like their namesake, the scorpion, put up an outer shell and may seem prickly.But once them get beyond the shell, they find a loyal, loving person whose passion knows no bounds.  \n\n In love, Scorpio can seem cautious at first, and may set up a series of 'tests'' for their potential partner, deciding to cross them off their list if they don't meet their demands. The trouble is, they tend to keep their partner out of the loop on what, exactly, they want, making their partner feel like they have to play mind reader. If a Scorpio and their partner can get past this initial hurdle, the connection will be intense, in both highs and lows. A Scorpio will love harder and fight harder than any other sign, and wants their partner to be absolutely honest. In the bedroom, Scorpio is generous, imaginative, and always up for anything—all night long.",
